# Court Cost Connect - Backend Server

This is the backend server for the Court Cost Connect application, built with Express.js, MongoDB, and Mongoose.

## Features

- **MongoDB Integration**: Robust database with Mongoose ODM
- **JWT Authentication**: Secure authentication with access and refresh tokens
- **Role-Based Access Control**: Admin and Member roles with appropriate permissions
- **RESTful API**: Complete CRUD operations for all entities

## Prerequisites

- Node.js (v18 or higher)
- MongoDB (local installation or MongoDB Atlas)
- npm or yarn

## Installation

1. Navigate to the server directory:
```bash
cd server
```

2. Install dependencies:
```bash
npm install
```

3. Create a `.env` file in the server directory (copy from `.env.example`):
```bash
PORT=5000
MONGODB_URI=mongodb://localhost:27017/court-cost-connect
JWT_SECRET=your-super-secret-jwt-key-change-this-in-production
JWT_REFRESH_SECRET=your-super-secret-refresh-token-key-change-this-in-production
JWT_EXPIRES_IN=15m
JWT_REFRESH_EXPIRES_IN=7d
NODE_ENV=development
FRONTEND_URL=http://localhost:8080
```

**Important**: Change the JWT secrets to strong, random strings in production!

## Running the Server

### Development Mode
```bash
npm run dev
```

The server will start on `http://localhost:5000` (or the port specified in `.env`).

### Production Mode
```bash
npm run build
npm start
```

```

The access token expires after 15 minutes (configurable). Use the refresh token endpoint to get a new access token.

Error responses follow this format:
```json
{
  "error": "Error message"
}
```

## Security Features

- Passwords are hashed using bcrypt
- JWT tokens for stateless authentication
- Refresh token mechanism for session persistence
- Role-based access control middleware
